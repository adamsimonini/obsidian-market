# Obsidian Market - Research & Market Validation

## Executive Summary

**Obsidian Market** is a prediction market platform built on the Aleo blockchain, offering privacy-preserving binary prediction markets with cross-platform support (iOS, Android, and Web). The platform enables users to create and participate in Yes/No prediction markets with fixed-odds betting, leveraging Aleo's zero-knowledge cryptography for transaction privacy.

## Purpose of the Application

### Core Mission
Obsidian Market democratizes access to prediction markets by providing a lightweight, privacy-focused platform that enables users to bet on future events across various topics. Unlike traditional prediction markets that operate on public blockchains, Obsidian Market leverages Aleo's privacy-preserving technology to protect user betting patterns and financial information.

### Key Value Propositions

1. **Privacy-Preserving Prediction Markets**
   - All transactions and bets are executed on Aleo blockchain with zero-knowledge proofs
   - User betting patterns, positions, and financial data remain private
   - Addresses a critical gap in existing prediction markets where all trades are publicly visible

3. **Decentralized & Trustless**
   - Smart contract-based escrow system ensures funds are secure
   - No central authority controls user funds
   - Transparent resolution process with admin-controlled market creation

### Target Use Cases

- **Political Events**: Betting on election outcomes, policy decisions, political events
- **Sports**: Game outcomes, championship winners, player performance
- **Technology**: Product launches, company milestones, tech industry events
- **Entertainment**: Award shows, box office performance, celebrity events
- **Finance**: Market movements, economic indicators, corporate events
- **General Knowledge**: Any future event with a clear Yes/No outcome

## Competitive Advantages

### 1. Privacy-First Architecture

**Differentiator**: Obsidian Market is built on Aleo, a privacy-preserving blockchain that uses zero-knowledge proofs to hide transaction details.

**Competitive Context**:
- **Polymarket** (largest prediction market): All trades are publicly visible on-chain, exposing user positions and betting strategies
- **Traditional prediction markets**: Require KYC/AML, exposing user identity and betting history
- **Obsidian Market**: Complete transaction privacy while maintaining verifiable on-chain settlement

**Market Opportunity**: 
- Privacy-conscious traders who don't want to expose their positions
- Institutional users who need to protect trading strategies
- Users in jurisdictions with restrictive gambling regulations

### 3. Emerging Blockchain Ecosystem

**Differentiator**: Built on Aleo, an emerging privacy-focused blockchain with growing developer and user adoption.

**Competitive Context**:
- **Polymarket**: Built on Polygon/Ethereum (mature but public)
- **Other prediction markets**: Mostly on Ethereum L2s or alternative chains
- **Obsidian Market**: Early mover in Aleo ecosystem, potential for first-mover advantage

**Market Opportunity**:
- Early adopters of Aleo blockchain technology
- Users seeking alternatives to Ethereum-based platforms
- Alignment with Aleo's growing ecosystem and developer community

### 5. Lightweight MVP Approach

**Differentiator**: Focused on core functionality with rapid iteration and time-to-market.

**Competitive Context**:
- **Polymarket**: Complex platform with many features, slower to adapt
- **Enterprise solutions**: Over-engineered, slow development cycles
- **Obsidian Market**: Lean MVP allows quick pivots and feature additions based on user feedback

**Market Opportunity**:
- Faster response to market demands
- Lower development and operational costs
- Ability to test and validate features quickly

### 6. Hybrid Architecture (On-Chain + Off-Chain)

**Differentiator**: Smart contracts handle financial transactions (bets, escrow, payouts) while Supabase handles metadata (descriptions, UI state, market info).

**Competitive Context**:
- **Fully on-chain**: Expensive, slow, limited metadata
- **Fully off-chain**: Centralized, trust required
- **Obsidian Market**: Best of both worlds - trustless financial layer with efficient metadata storage

**Market Opportunity**:
- Lower transaction costs for non-financial data
- Faster UI updates and real-time market information
- Scalable architecture that can handle high transaction volumes

## Market Validation Questions

### For AI Evaluation:

1. **Market Demand**: Is there sufficient demand for privacy-preserving prediction markets? Are users willing to trade on a newer blockchain (Aleo) vs. established platforms?

2. **Competitive Moat**: Are the competitive advantages (privacy, simplicity, cross-platform) strong enough to differentiate from Polymarket and other established players?

3. **Investor Interest**: Would investors be interested in a prediction market platform built on Aleo? Is the privacy-preserving angle compelling enough for funding?

4. **User Adoption**: Will users migrate from established platforms (Polymarket) to a new platform? What is the switching cost and friction?

5. **Regulatory Risk**: How do privacy-preserving features affect regulatory compliance? Are there jurisdictions where this is an advantage or disadvantage?

6. **Technical Feasibility**: Is Aleo blockchain mature enough to support a production prediction market? Are there scalability or performance concerns?

7. **Business Model**: What is the revenue model? Transaction fees? Market creation fees? How does this compare to competitors?

8. **Go-to-Market Strategy**: How will Obsidian Market acquire users? What is the marketing strategy to compete with established platforms? Polymarket current has a 2.6/5 stars in the Android app store. The app experience is not stable for many users

9. **Network Effects**: Prediction markets benefit from network effects (more users = better liquidity = more accurate odds). Can Obsidian Market overcome the cold start problem?

10. **Long-term Viability**: Is this a sustainable business or a feature that could be added to existing platforms? What prevents Polymarket from adding privacy features?

## Key Metrics for Success

- **User Growth**: Number of active users and wallets connected
- **Market Activity**: Number of markets created, bets placed, total volume
- **Liquidity**: Average market size and bet frequency
- **Retention**: User return rate and engagement metrics
- **Revenue**: Transaction fees and platform revenue
- **Network Growth**: Growth of Aleo ecosystem and developer adoption

## Conclusion

Obsidian Market aims to capture market share in the prediction market space by offering privacy-preserving transactions, simplified user experience, and cross-platform accessibility. The platform leverages Aleo's emerging blockchain technology to differentiate from established players like Polymarket, while maintaining focus on core functionality through a lightweight MVP approach.

The success of Obsidian Market depends on:
1. User willingness to adopt Aleo blockchain
2. Strength of privacy-preserving value proposition
3. Ability to overcome network effects of established platforms
4. Execution of go-to-market strategy
5. Maturity and scalability of Aleo blockchain infrastructure
